****Not supported on Python3.7***

Important note: Do not simply use pip install kivy to install kivy because even though the command may run without errors, you may get a [CRITICAL] [App] Unable to get a Window, abort error later on when you run a kivy app. Instead, see the instructions below in order to install kivy correctly.


Mac and Linux users
Kivy currently only works with Python 3.7 or earlier on Mac and Linux. You might want to install Python 3.7 first, and then install kivy for your Python 3.7 with:

python3.7 -m pip install kivy

Tip: If you just installed Python 3.7, make sure to configure your IDE to use Python 3.7, otherwise your IDE may be still using the other version of Python.



Windows users
- Python 3.7 or earlier

If you are using Python 3.7 or earlier, run all three following commands one by one:

pip install kivy

pip install kivy.deps.glew

pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2
